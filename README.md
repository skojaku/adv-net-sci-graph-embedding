# Workflow

1. Complete [the assignment notebook](assignment/assignment.ipynb)
2. Git add, commit, push the notebook. If you are not sure what they are, [here is a guide](https://graphite.dev/guides/git-add-commit-push)
3. The assignment will be auto-graded, and you can check out the results at [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/learn-with-github-classroom/view-autograding-results)


# Computing environment

## Github Classroom

You can use Github Codespaces to complete the assignment. Note that this environment is not permanent and will be deleted after the course finishes. You can keep files in the codespace by git-pushing them to the repository.

## Local Machine

You can download the repo and work locally on your machine. Using "git clone" is the easiest way to do this.

## Google Colab

You can work on the assignment by uploading the assignment notebook to Google Colab. Note, however, that you  must upload your completed assignment to the Github repository at the original file location for submission.
